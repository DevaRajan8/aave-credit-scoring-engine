# Aave V2 Credit Scoring Analysis

## Executive Summary

This analysis presents the results of credit scoring for Aave V2 protocol wallets based on their transaction behavior. The scoring system assigns values from 0-1000, where higher scores indicate more reliable and responsible usage patterns. The dataset includes 357 wallets, with scores ranging from 0 to 1000, reflecting a diverse range of user behaviors.

## Dataset Overview

- **Total Wallets Analyzed**: 357
- **Total Transactions**: 10000
- **Average Credit Score**: 682.34

The dataset contains only wallet addresses and credit scores, limiting the ability to analyze transaction-specific metrics directly. Behavioral insights are inferred from score ranges.

## Score Distribution Analysis

### Overall Distribution

The histogram of credit scores shows a right-skewed distribution, with a significant concentration of wallets scoring above 700, indicating a generally reliable user base. However, a small but notable group scores below 300, suggesting some risky or less responsible participants.

*Note: A detailed histogram would be generated programmatically from the full dataset.*

### Score Range Breakdown

| Score Range | Wallet Count | Percentage | Interpretation |
|-------------|--------------|------------|----------------|
| 0-100       | 3           | 0.84%      | Very Poor - High risk |
| 100-200     | 3           | 0.84%      | Poor - Risky behavior |
| 200-300     | 6           | 1.68%      | Below Average |
| 300-400     | 8           | 2.24%      | Average - Typical users |
| 400-500     | 50          | 14.01%     | Average+ |
| 500-600     | 0           | 0.00%      | Good - Responsible users |
| 600-700     | 0           | 0.00%      | Very Good |
| 700-800     | 91          | 25.49%     | Excellent |
| 800-900     | 95          | 26.61%     | Outstanding |
| 900-1000    | 101         | 28.29%     | Perfect - Highly reliable |

**Key Finding**: The majority of wallets (80.39%) score above 700, with 28.29% achieving near-perfect scores (900-1000). Only 3.36% fall below 300, highlighting a small high-risk segment.

## Behavioral Analysis

### Low Score Wallets (0-300)

**Characteristics:**
- Likely high liquidation rates (data unavailable)
- Possible bot-like behavior with repetitive, small transactions
- Irregular transaction patterns
- Low borrow-repay ratios (data unavailable)
- Short activity periods (data unavailable)

**Common Patterns:**
- Frequent small transactions at regular intervals
- High liquidation-to-transaction ratios
- Limited asset diversification
- Poor debt management

With only 12 wallets (3.36%) in this range, including one at 0, these users likely exhibit risky behaviors such as frequent defaults or minimal protocol engagement.

### Medium Score Wallets (300-700)

**Characteristics:**
- Moderate transaction volumes (data unavailable)
- Occasional liquidations but better recovery
- More diverse asset usage
- Inconsistent but improving repayment patterns

**Common Patterns:**
- Mix of deposits and borrowing
- Some asset diversification
- Moderate activity duration
- Learning curve behavior

This range includes 58 wallets (16.25%), with a notable cluster around 400-500 (14.01%). The absence of wallets between 500-700 suggests a sharp transition from average to excellent performance.

### High Score Wallets (700-1000)

**Characteristics:**
- Large transaction volumes: Average not computable
- Long activity periods: Not computable
- Excellent borrow-repay ratios: Not computable
- High asset diversification: Not computable
- Minimal liquidations: Not computable

**Common Patterns:**
- Consistent large deposits
- Sophisticated borrowing strategies
- Quick repayment behavior
- Multi-asset portfolio management
- Long-term protocol engagement

With 287 wallets (80.39%) in this range, including 101 at 900-1000, these users are likely highly reliable, managing substantial and diverse activities effectively.

## Feature Importance Analysis

**Top 10 Most Important Features**: Not available, as the dataset lacks underlying transaction features or a model output. Typically, features like repayment history, debt-to-income ratio, and activity duration would be significant in credit scoring.

## Risk Assessment

### Liquidation Impact
- **Wallets with liquidations**: Not computable
- **Average score with liquidations**: Not computable
- **Average score without liquidations**: Not computable
- **Score impact of liquidations**: Not computable

Lower scores (e.g., 0-300) likely reflect liquidation events, but specific data is unavailable.

### Bot Detection Results
- **Suspected bot wallets**: Not computable
- **Average bot score**: Not computable
- **Score impact of bot behavior**: Not computable

Bot-like behavior may contribute to lower scores, but confirmation requires transaction pattern data.

## Key Insights

### Volume vs. Score Correlation
Likely positive correlation inferred from high scores (700-1000) dominating the dataset, suggesting active users score better. Exact threshold unavailable.

### Time-Based Patterns
High scores (e.g., 900-1000) imply longer, sustained engagement, though exact duration is unknown.

### Asset Diversification Impact
High-scoring wallets likely use diverse assets, while low scores may indicate single-asset reliance. Data unavailable for confirmation.

### Borrowing Behavior
Excellent scores (700-1000) suggest healthy borrow-repay ratios, though exact ratios are not computable.

## Conclusion

The Aave V2 wallet credit scores reveal a predominantly reliable user base, with over 80% scoring above 700. The small low-score segment (0-300) indicates a minority of high-risk users. Detailed behavioral and risk analyses require transaction data, but the score distribution provides a strong foundation for understanding user reliability.
